    <h1 class="text-lg font-bold">Why I stopped working on flowy (after it consumed me for 3+ years)</h1>
    <p>Psychological triggers: I am quite a persistent person, or rather stubborn when it comes to my world view. I saw it fit into the world cleanly.
    </p>
    <p>In general, I am confident in the strategy that if you try hard to advancing an aspect of human life (whether it's communication with flowy, note-taking as in the case of Notion, or fitness tracking like Whoop), you can win. You just have to stick with it.</p>

    <p>Who else in the world is thinking about re-inventing communication (getting rid of email, phone calls, voicemail, text, zoom), into one smooth protocol? No one. That's why I believe in this simple strategy: smart/young people + simple, bold bet + long time period = magical transformation.</p>

    <p>It also is an invisible problem. We deal with putting out head down all day to look at our phone. We have missed calls, spam calls, millions of email from automated bots and campaigns, and we just deal with it like it's normal.</p>

    <p>I have 4,500+ commits in the flowy repository. I have thrown away and restarted over 9 times, from infrastructure code to APIs to media systems to clients (from QT to flutter linux to flutter android to ios to web to rust GUIs). I've done it all with flowy. I'm kind of proud of that, despite there not being any external feedback or success. This git repository is a testament to my craft, and it just feels good.</p>

    <p>The goal is that I can just say "hey Jordan, can you take a look at my PR" and he should hear it. No interface, hands-free.</p>

    <h2>Assumptions</h2>

    <p>I didn't think through why there are mediums such as pagers and walkie-talkies. That in combination with my naivety about hardware cost of development made me overlook the challenge of building something so small and sexy as an auxilliary flowy device or an edge device that I discovered that it would turn into something as ugly as a voice pager in the end. No one would buy that as revolutionary. It was also limits of how good of a screen we can put on a device until it became super bulky as well and we would not be able to get to the size of an ipad. It would need a battery and all the other things which would eventually make it into an iPhone. As far as technology has advanced, being able to build a slim and sexy IOT device just isn't as easy as it seems.</p>

    <p>We tried building on top of a platform starting in December 2023: Apple mac desktop app. It looks nice with a map and all, but it's still heavy and development sucks with the shitty API documentation and also lack of maturity in Swift for complex data flows.</p>
